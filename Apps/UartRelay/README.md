# Tactility Enhanced for T-Deck

**Full hardware support for LilyGO T-Deck with enhanced features**

## Overview

Tactility Enhanced is a custom distribution of [Tactility OS](https://github.com/ByteWelder/Tactility) specifically optimized for the LilyGO T-Deck, unlocking hardware features not available in the stock firmware.

### What Makes This Different?

This build enables **full T-Deck hardware utilization** that stock Tactility doesn't provide:

#### ✅ Working Features:
- **USB Serial JTAG** - Bidirectional relay support (Rx + Tx)
- **UART Relay App** - Monitor and control serial devices with USB/SD logging
- **Firmware exports** - Extended symbol table for advanced app development

#### 🚧 In Development:
- **Keyboard backlight control** - Adjust brightness programmatically
- **Trackball support** - Full navigation integration
- **WiFi file server** - Upload apps and files wirelessly
- **Web-based serial terminal** - Access UART over WiFi
- **4G LTE support** - Cellular connectivity
- **GPS integration** - Location services and geo-tagged logging
- **LoRa transceiver** - Long-range communication

### Key Applications

**UartRelay** - Flagship app for this distribution
- Bidirectional UART relay (device ↔ USB/WiFi)
- SD card logging with timestamps
- Real-time serial monitoring
- Configurable baud rates and protocols
- Future: GPS-tagged logs, remote access via 4G

## Why This Fork Exists

The LilyGO T-Deck is packed with features (WiFi, 4G, GPS, LoRa, trackball, backlit keyboard) that aren't fully utilized by existing firmware options. This project aims to:

1. **Enable all hardware** - Every feature should work
2. **Professional tools** - Advanced debugging and development capabilities
3. **Field deployment** - Reliable remote access and monitoring
4. **Developer friendly** - Extended API for custom apps

## Hardware Support

**Fully Supported:**
- LilyGO T-Deck (all variants)
- ESP32-S3 with 8MB+ PSRAM

**Tested On:**
- LilyGO T-Deck v1.0

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- LilyGO T-Deck device
- USB-C cable
- SD card (recommended: 8GB+)

### Quick Start

1. **Download latest release**
